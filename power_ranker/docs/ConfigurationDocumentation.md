# Configuration File Documentation
The default configuration values are able to give you accurate power rankings, however,
you may need to adjust some parameters to fit your specific league. The only specific
configuration required, is for the [League Info](#league_info) section. The [Tiers](#tiers) section is also 
useful for producing an appropriate amount of tiers.
